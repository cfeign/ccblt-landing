## Configure Custom Domain

Once deployed to Cloudflare Pages:

1. Go to your Pages project â†’ **Settings**
2. Click **Domains**
3. Click **Add custom domain**
4. Enter: `ccblt.coryfeign.com`
5. Click **Continue**
6. Add DNS records in your domain registrar:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: ccblt
Value: [YOUR-PAGES-DEPLOYMENT].pages.dev
TTL: Auto
```

(The exact value is shown in Cloudflare)

7. Wait for DNS propagation (5-15 min)
8. Your site is live at https://ccblt.coryfeign.com! ðŸŽ‰

## Manual Deployment with Wrangler

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Authenticate with Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Deploy the build
wrangler pages deploy dist

# Or use npm script
bun run deploy
```

---

## GitHub Integration Details

Cloudflare Pages automatically:
- âœ… Watches your repo for changes
- âœ… Triggers builds on push to main
- âœ… Deploys on successful build
- âœ… Keeps build history
- âœ… Provides rollback capability

No additional config needed!

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "bun not found"

Cloudflare may not have Bun. Use this workaround:

**In Cloudflare Pages build settings:**
```
Build command: npm install -g bun && bun run build
```

Or switch to npm:
```
Build command: npm install && npm run build
```

### Domain not resolving

1. Verify CNAME record is correct
2. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Use https://mxtoolbox.com/cname.aspx to check DNS

### Site shows "Page not found"

1. Check Cloudflare Pages build logs
2. Verify `dist/index.html` exists locally
3. Run `bun run build` locally to test
4. Redeploy manually if needed

### Want to see build logs?

```bash
# In Cloudflare Pages:
Your project â†’ Deployments â†’ Click any deployment â†’ View build log
```

---

## Environment Variables (Optional)

To add env vars for analytics, tracking, etc.:

1. Cloudflare Pages â†’ Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add key/value pairs
3. Redeploy

Example:
```
ANALYTICS_ID = YOUR_ID
SITE_URL = https://ccblt.coryfeign.com
```

---

## Monitoring

### Check Build Status

```bash
# View latest deployments
wrangler pages deployments list

# View specific deployment
wrangler pages deployment info <DEPLOYMENT_ID>
```

### Monitor Performance

1. Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Pages â†’ Your project
2. **Analyze** tab shows:
   - Traffic (requests per day)
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Visitor locations

---

## Rollback

If something breaks:

1. Cloudflare Pages â†’ Your project â†’ Deployments
2. Find previous good deployment
3. Click three dots â†’ **Rollback to this deployment**
4. Done! Site reverts instantly

---

## Continuous Deployment Flow

```
You push code to main
    â†“
GitHub webhook alerts Cloudflare
    â†“
Cloudflare clones repo
    â†“
Cloudflare runs: bun run build
    â†“
Output uploaded to Pages CDN
    â†“
Site live at ccblt.coryfeign.com
    â†“
Available globally on Cloudflare edge (180+ data centers)
```

---

## Performance Tips

Your site is already optimized, but:

1. **Use Cloudflare Analytics** to monitor performance
2. **Minimize images** - currently zero images (good!)
3. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** - should all be green
4. **Cache-busting** - Cloudflare handles this automatically

---

## Updating After Deployment

The workflow is simple:

```bash
# Make changes
# ...edit files...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update landing page"
git push origin main

# That's it! Cloudflare auto-deploys
```

---

## Custom Domain Setup Summary

### Before Deployment:
- âœ… GitHub repo created
- âœ… Cloudflare Pages connected
- âœ… Initial deployment in progress

### After DNS is ready:
```
https://ccblt.coryfeign.com â†’ Your landing page! ðŸš€
